    "<p style=\"list-style-type:circle;font-family:Yu Mincho Demibold;font-size:20px;color:black\"> Speech Emotion Recognition, or SER for short, is the process of trying to identify affective and emotional states in speech. This makes use of the fact that tone and pitch in the voice frequently convey underlying emotion. In order to comprehend human emotion, animals like dogs and horses also use this phenomenon. The component of speech recognition that is growing in popularity and demand is emotion recognition. Although there are ways to identify emotions from data using machine learning methods, this research tries to use deep learning to do so. SER (Speech Emotion Recognition) is used in contact centers to categorize conversations based on emotions and can be used as a performance metric for conversational analysis to identify the dissatisfied client, customer satisfaction, and other factors that can help businesses improve their services. It can also be utilized as an in-car board system based on information about the driver's mental state to ensure the driver's safety and prevent accidents.</p>\n",

I did notice that there's a very short silence period between start and end. We could potentially trim it later to enhance the quality. Also, the sentence uttered is different so its not exactly an apple to apple comparison but it still gives us a good early indication of what we're dealing with. \n",

So for convenience, here's the filename identifiers as per the official RAVDESS website:\n",

    "- Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.\n",
    "- Statement (01 = \"Kids are talking by the door\", 02 = \"Dogs are sitting by the door\").\n",

From reading a few blogs and articles, it seems female has a higher pitch that male. So if we don't tag the gender label to the audio file, it won't be able to detect anger or fear if it was a male speaker. It will just get bucketed into neutral \n",

    "The same sentence uttered and quite convincing that its a fearful emotion there. Much clearer than the happy version. Now, I went back to listen a few more random tracks and what I noticed with this CREMA-D dataset is that its is highly varied in its quality. Some are crisp clear and some are really muffled or echoey. Also there's lots of silence as well. All in all, slightly 'dirtier' version of the data. But still good quality data none the less and we'll definitely use it. On the up side, a slightly noisy dataset would serve as a very good data augmentation by introducing noise to the pattern which we don't have so far. "
